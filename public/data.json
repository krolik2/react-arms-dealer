Its steel four port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick attach Barrett QDL Suppressor. The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold. Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability.",

Not only does the surface treatment bring the hardness up to a Rockwell of 72, it also increases lubricity, meaning a little oil keeps the Sonoran running smooth as butter. Clad in its olive drab carbon fiber stock, it s the rifle built to weather the toughest hunts on the planet.",
